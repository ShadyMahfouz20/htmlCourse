I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

This is the first line.

And this is the second line.

First line with two spaces after.

And the next line.

First line with the HTML tag after.

And the next line.

I just love **bold text**.

Love **is** bold

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

A *cat* meow

This text is ***really important***.

This is really ***very*** important text.

Try to put a blank line before...

> This is a blockquote

...and after a blockquote.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

- I think 1969 was second best.

At the command prompt, type `nano`.

Use `code` in your Markdown file.

Try to put a blank line before...
